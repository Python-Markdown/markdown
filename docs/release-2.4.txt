Python-Markdown 2.4 Release Notes
=================================

We are pleased to release Python-Markdown 2.4 which adds one new extension
and fixes various bugs. See the list of changes below for details.

Python-Markdown supports Python versions 2.6, 2.7, 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3.

Backwards-incompatible Changes
------------------------------

* The `force_linenos` configuration setting of the CodeHilite extension has been
marked as **Deprecated**. It had previously been marked as "Pending Deprecation"
in version 2.3 when a new setting `linenums` was added to replace it. See 
documentation for the [CodeHilite Extension] for an explanation of the new 
`linenums` setting. The new setting will honor the old `force_linenos` if it 
is set, but `force_linenos` will raise a `DeprecationWarning` and will likely 
be removed in a future version of Python-Markdown.

* URLs are no longer percent-encoded. This improves compatibility with the
original (written in Perl) Markdown implementation. Please percent-encode
your URLs manually when needed.

What's New in Python-Markdown 2.4
---------------------------------

* Thanks to the hard work of [Dmitry Shachnev] the [Smarty Extension] has been 
added, which implements [SmartyPants] using Python-Markdown's Extension API. 
This offers a few benefits over a third party script. The HTML does not need
to be "tokenized" twice, no hacks are required to combine SmartyPants and
code highlighting, and we get markdown's escaping feature for free. Please try 
it out and report bugs and/or improvements.

* The [Table of Contents Extension] now supports new `permalink` option
for creating [Sphinx]-style anchor links.

* It is now possible to enable Markdown formatting inside HTML blocks by
appending `markdown=1` to opening tag attributes. See [Markdown Inside HTML
Blocks] section for details. Thanks to [ryneeverett] for implementing this
feature.

* The code blocks now support emphasizing some of the code lines. To use this
feature, specify `hl_lines` option after language name, for example (using
the [Fenced Code Extension]):

        ```.python hl_lines="1 3"
        # This line will be emphasized.
        # This one won't.
        # This one will be also emphasized.
        ```

    Thanks to [A. Jesse Jiryu Davis] for implementing this feature.
